# Beginner Java Project: Shape Generator
"COMP2502	Human Computer Interaction" course project. 2021

## About the project
This is a project, assigned to me from my school.

This is a primitive shape generator, firstly intented to be a MS Paint clone.

To erase a shape, after clicking the "erase" button, click anywhere empty on the screen, only then you can delete a shape. It is a bug.
